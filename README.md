# gestalts

## **Statement of Purpose:**

We’re addressing a major pain point for Australian families managing autism therapy. Currently, a carer records 2-hour daily conversations with a child, then spends 3-4 additional hours manually transcribing every word and hand-categorizing phrases to track therapeutic progress. This creates an unsustainable 5+ hour daily burden that often leads to incomplete therapy documentation.
The core problem: families need to identify repeated phrases (called “scripts” or “gestalts”) and track whether the child is using new combinations versus exact repetitions. Right now, this requires listening to hours of audio, writing everything down by hand, then analyzing patterns manually. The carer might think they’ve spotted a new phrase development, but needs the parent to verify since they’re the “source of truth” for what the child has said before.
The opportunity is clear - this is purely a workflow automation problem. Families are desperate for technology to handle the transcription and basic pattern recognition, freeing them to focus on actual therapy rather than administrative work. We have a specific family who approached us and represents a much larger underserved market.
The technical solution involves speech-to-text plus pattern analysis, but the business case is straightforward: we’re not inventing new therapy methods, just automating an existing manual process that’s proven valuable but impossibly time-consuming.
This frames it as a workflow problem with clear user pain points and market validation.
